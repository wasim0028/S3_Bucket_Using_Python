For this tutorial to work, we will need an IAM user who has access to upload a file to S3. 
We can configure this user on our local machine using AWS CLI or we can use its credentials directly in python script.
Then we learn how we can list all buckets in AWS S3 using python and how we can move local files from our machine to the S3 bucket.
At end how to delete files from the S3 bucket and how to delete empty S3 bucket using python.
